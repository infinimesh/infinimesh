# When specified reported file paths will not contain local prefix in the output

# Holds coverage thresholds percentages, values should be in range [0-100]
threshold:
  # (optional; default 0) 
  # The minimum coverage that each file should have
  # file: 70 # TODO: Enforce, once we have a good coverage

  # (optional; default 0) 
  # The minimum coverage that each package should have
  # package: 80 # TODO: Enforce, once we have a good coverage

  # (optional; default 0) 
  # The minimum total coverage project should have
  # total: 95 # TODO: Enforce, once we have a good coverage

# Holds regexp rules which will override thresholds for matched files or packages using their paths.
#
# First rule from this list that matches file or package is going to apply new threshold to it. 
# If project has multiple rules that match same path, override rules should be listed in order from 
# specific to more general rules.
# override:
#   # Increase coverage threshold to 100% for `foo` package (default is 80, as configured above)
#   - threshold: 100
#     path: ^pkg/lib/foo$

# Holds regexp rules which will exclude matched files or packages from coverage statistics
exclude:
  # Exclude files or packages matching their paths
  paths:
    - \.pb\.go$    # excludes all protobuf generated files
    - mock_.*\.go$ # excludes all mock files
 
# NOTES:
# - symbol `/` in all path regexps will be replaced by
#   current OS file path separator to properly work on Windows
