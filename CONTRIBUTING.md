About
=====

This document provides a set of best practices for open source contributions -
bug reports, code submissions / pull requests, etc.

For the most part, these guidelines apply equally to *any* project regardless
of programming language or topic. Where applicable, we outline where individual
projects/languages may have additional requirements.

Naturally, this document is itself open source, and we encourage feedback &
suggestions for improvement.

Submitting bugs
===============

Due diligence
-------------

Before submitting a bug, please do the following:

* Perform **basic troubleshooting** steps:

    * **Make sure you're on the latest version.** If you're not on the most
      recent version, your problem may have been solved already! Upgrading is
      always the best first step.
    * **Try older versions.** If you're already *on* the latest release, try
      rolling back a few minor versions (e.g. if on 1.7, try 1.5 or 1.6) and
      see if the problem goes away. This will help the devs narrow down when
      the problem first arose in the commit log.
    * **Try switching up dependency versions.** If the software in question has
      dependencies (other libraries, etc) try upgrading/downgrading those as
      well.

* **Search the project's bug/issue tracker** to make sure it's not a known
  issue.
* If you don't find a pre-existing issue, consider **checking with the mailing
  list and/or IRC channel** in case the problem is non-bug-related.

What to put in your bug report
------------------------------

Make sure your report gets the attention it deserves: bug reports with missing
information may be ignored or punted back to you, delaying a fix.  The below
constitutes a bare minimum; more info is almost always better:

* **What version of the core programming language compiler are you
  using?** As example, golang version 1.65.Freebsd. A list of all golang versions can be found here: https://golang.org/dl/
* **What operating system are you on?** Windows? (Vista? 7? 32-bit? 64-bit?)
  Mac OS X?  (10.7.4? 10.9.0?) Linux? (Which distro? Which version of that
  distro? 32 or 64 bits?) Again, more detail is better.
* **Which version or versions of the software are you using?** Ideally, you
  followed the advice above and have ruled out (or verified that the problem
  exists in) a few different versions.
* **How can the developers recreate the bug on their end?** If possible,
  include a copy of your code, the command you used to invoke it, and the full
  output of your run (if applicable.)

    * A common tactic is to pare down your code until a simple (but still
      bug-causing) "base case" remains. Not only can this help you identify
      problems which aren't real bugs, but it means the developer can get to
      fixing the bug faster.


Contributing changes
====================

Licensing of contributed material
---------------------------------

Keep in mind as you contribute, that code, docs and other material submitted to
open source projects are usually considered licensed under the same terms
as the rest of the work.

The details vary from project to project, but from the perspective of this
document's authors:

- Anything submitted to a project falls under the licensing terms in the
  repository's top level ``LICENSE`` file.

- Per-file copyright/license headers are typically extraneous and undesirable.
  Please don't add your own copyright headers to new files unless the project's
  license actually requires them!

    - Not least because even a new file created by one individual (who often
      feels compelled to put their personal copyright notice at the top) will
      inherently end up contributed to by dozens of others over time, making a
      per-file header outdated/misleading.

- We only accept contributions with the Apache Software License Version 2.0


Version control branching
-------------------------

* Always **make a new branch** for your work, no matter how small. This makes
  it easy for others to take just that one set of changes from your repository,
  in case you have multiple unrelated changes floating around.

    * A corollary: **don't submit unrelated changes in the same branch/pull
      request**! The maintainer shouldn't have to reject your awesome bugfix
      because the feature you put in with it needs more review.

* **Base your new branch off of the appropriate branch** on the main
  repository:

    * **Bug fixes** should be based on the branch named after the **oldest
      supported release line** the bug affects.

        * E.g. if a feature was introduced in 1.1, the latest release line is
          1.3, and a bug is found in that feature - make your branch based on
          1.1.  The maintainer will then forward-port it to 1.3 and master.
        * Bug fixes requiring large changes to the code or which have a chance
          of being otherwise disruptive, may need to base off of **master**
          instead. This is a judgement call -- ask the devs!

    * **New features** should branch off of **the 'master' branch**.

        * Note that depending on how long it takes for the dev team to merge
          your patch, the copy of ``master`` you worked off of may get out of
          date! If you find yourself 'bumping' a pull request that's been
          sidelined for a while, **make sure you rebase or merge to latest
          master** to ensure a speedier resolution.

Code formatting
---------------

* **Follow the style you see used in the primary repository**! Consistency with
  the rest of the project always trumps other considerations. It doesn't matter
  if you have your own style or if the rest of the code breaks with the greater
  community - just follow along.
* We follow the Uber Go Style <https://github.com/uber-go/guide/blob/master/style.md> (though many have
  minor deviations depending on the lead maintainers' preferences.)

Documentation isn't optional
----------------------------

It's not! Patches without documentation will be returned to sender.  By
"documentation" we mean:

* **Docstrings** (for Go; or API-doc-friendly comments for other languages)
  must be created or updated for public API functions/methods/etc. (This step
  is optional for some bugfixes.)

    * Don't forget to include `versionadded` / `versionchanged` ReST
      directives at the bottom of any new or changed Go docstrings!

        * Use ``versionadded`` for truly new API members -- new methods,
          functions, classes or modules.
        * Use ``versionchanged`` when adding/removing new function/method
          arguments, or whenever behavior changes.

* New features should ideally include updates to **prose documentation**,
  including useful example code snippets.
* All submissions should have a **changelog entry** crediting the contributor
  and/or any individuals instrumental in identifying the problem.

Tests aren't optional
---------------------

Any bugfix that doesn't include a test proving the existence of the bug being
fixed, may be suspect.  Ditto for new features that can't prove they actually
work.

We've found that test-first development really helps make features better
architected and identifies potential edge cases earlier instead of later.
Writing tests before the implementation is strongly encouraged.

Full example
------------

Here's an example workflow:

***Preparing your Fork***

1. Click 'Fork' on Github, creating e.g. ``yourname/infinimesh``.
2. Clone your project: ``git clone git@github.com:yourname/infinimesh``.
3. ``cd infinimesh``
4. Install Go for your operating system => https://golang.org/doc/install
5. Create a branch: ``git checkout -b foo 0.1``.

***Making your Changes***

1. Add changelog entry crediting yourself.
2. Write tests expecting the correct/fixed functionality; make sure they fail.
3. Hack, hack, hack.
4. Run tests again, making sure they pass.
5. Commit your changes: ``git commit -m "I did awesome work, tested and it works!"``

***Creating Pull Requests***

1. Push your commit to get it back up to your fork: ``git push --set-upstream origin foo``
2. Visit Github, click handy "Pull request" button that it will make upon
   noticing your new branch.
3. In the description field, write down issue number (if submitting code fixing
   an existing issue) or describe the issue + your fix (if submitting a wholly
   new bugfix).
4. Hit 'submit'! And please be patient - the maintainers will get to you when
   they can.
