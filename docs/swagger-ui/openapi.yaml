    protobufAny:
      description: >-
        `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along
        with a

        URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

            Foo foo = ...;
            Any any;
            any.PackFrom(foo);
            ...
            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
              ...
            }

        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

            Foo foo = ...;
            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
            ...
            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
            }

         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

            foo = Foo(...)
            any = Any()
            any.Pack(foo)
            ...
            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
              any.Unpack(foo)
              ...

         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
             any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
             ...
             foo := &pb.Foo{}
             if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
               ...
             }

        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

        name "y.z".



        JSON

        ====

        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

            package google.profile;
            message Person {
              string first_name = 1;
              string last_name = 2;
            }

            {
              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
              "firstName": <string>,
              "lastName": <string>
            }

        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

            {
              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
              "value": "1.212s"
            }
      properties:
        type_url:
          description: >-
            A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the
            serialized

            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

            the fully qualified name of the type (as in

            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical
            form

            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that
            they

            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use
            the

            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a
            type

            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
              value in binary format, or produce an error.
            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
              breaking changes.)

            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

            type.googleapis.com.


            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

            used with implementation specific semantics.
          type: string
        value:
          description: >-
            Must be a valid serialized protocol buffer of the above specified
            type.
          format: byte
          type: string
      type: object
    protobufFieldMask:
      description: >-
        paths: "f.a"
            paths: "f.b.d"

        Here `f` represents a field in some root message, `a` and `b`

        fields in the message found in `f`, and `d` a field found in the

        message in `f.b`.


        Field masks are used to specify a subset of fields that should be

        returned by a get operation or modified by an update operation.

        Field masks also have a custom JSON encoding (see below).


        # Field Masks in Projections


        When used in the context of a projection, a response message or

        sub-message is filtered by the API to only contain those fields as

        specified in the mask. For example, if the mask in the previous

        example is applied to a response message as follows:

            f {
              a : 22
              b {
                d : 1
                x : 2
              }
              y : 13
            }
            z: 8

        The result will not contain specific values for fields x,y and z

        (their value will be set to the default, and omitted in proto text

        output):


            f {
              a : 22
              b {
                d : 1
              }
            }

        A repeated field is not allowed except at the last position of a

        paths string.


        If a FieldMask object is not present in a get operation, the

        operation applies to all fields (as if a FieldMask of all fields

        had been specified).


        Note that a field mask does not necessarily apply to the

        top-level response message. In case of a REST get operation, the

        field mask applies directly to the response, but in case of a REST

        list operation, the mask instead applies to each individual message

        in the returned resource list. In case of a REST custom method,

        other definitions may be used. Where the mask applies will be

        clearly documented together with its declaration in the API.  In

        any case, the effect on the returned resource/resources is required

        behavior for APIs.


        # Field Masks in Update Operations


        A field mask in update operations specifies which fields of the

        targeted resource are going to be updated. The API is required

        to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask

        and leave the others untouched. If a resource is passed in to

        describe the updated values, the API ignores the values of all

        fields not covered by the mask.


        If a repeated field is specified for an update operation, new values
        will

        be appended to the existing repeated field in the target resource. Note
        that

        a repeated field is only allowed in the last position of a `paths`
        string.


        If a sub-message is specified in the last position of the field mask for
        an

        update operation, then new value will be merged into the existing
        sub-message

        in the target resource.


        For example, given the target message:

            f {
              b {
                d: 1
                x: 2
              }
              c: [1]
            }

        And an update message:

            f {
              b {
                d: 10
              }
              c: [2]
            }

        then if the field mask is:

         paths: ["f.b", "f.c"]

        then the result will be:

            f {
              b {
                d: 10
                x: 2
              }
              c: [1, 2]
            }

        An implementation may provide options to override this default behavior
        for

        repeated and message fields.


        In order to reset a field's value to the default, the field must

        be in the mask and set to the default value in the provided resource.

        Hence, in order to reset all fields of a resource, provide a default

        instance of the resource and set all fields in the mask, or do

        not provide a mask as described below.


        If a field mask is not present on update, the operation applies to

        all fields (as if a field mask of all fields has been specified).

        Note that in the presence of schema evolution, this may mean that

        fields the client does not know and has therefore not filled into

        the request will be reset to their default. If this is unwanted

        behavior, a specific service may require a client to always specify

        a field mask, producing an error if not.


        As with get operations, the location of the resource which

        describes the updated values in the request message depends on the

        operation kind. In any case, the effect of the field mask is

        required to be honored by the API.


        ## Considerations for HTTP REST


        The HTTP kind of an update operation which uses a field mask must

        be set to PATCH instead of PUT in order to satisfy HTTP semantics

        (PUT must only be used for full updates).


        # JSON Encoding of Field Masks


        In JSON, a field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are

        separated by a comma. Fields name in each path are converted

        to/from lower-camel naming conventions.


        As an example, consider the following message declarations:

            message Profile {
              User user = 1;
              Photo photo = 2;
            }
            message User {
              string display_name = 1;
              string address = 2;
            }

        In proto a field mask for `Profile` may look as such:

            mask {
              paths: "user.display_name"
              paths: "photo"
            }

        In JSON, the same mask is represented as below:

            {
              mask: "user.displayName,photo"
            }

        # Field Masks and Oneof Fields


        Field masks treat fields in oneofs just as regular fields. Consider the

        following message:

            message SampleMessage {
              oneof test_oneof {
                string name = 4;
                SubMessage sub_message = 9;
              }
            }

        The field mask can be:

            mask {
              paths: "name"
            }

        Or:

            mask {
              paths: "sub_message"
            }

        Note that oneof type names ("test_oneof" in this case) cannot be used in

        paths.


        ## Field Mask Verification


        The implementation of any API method which has a FieldMask type field in
        the

        request should verify the included field paths, and return an

        `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error if any path is unmappable.
