As you can see whole page, except [**Create Account**](#create-account) button, is just a table.
Is consists of 5 columns:

 2. Username
 3. User ID (shown only if your current user is admin of the namespace)
 4. Type (User, Admin or Root)
 5. State - enabled(green) or disabled(red)
 6. Actions Button
    By clicking on it you would get a Context Menu, where you can [**Reset Password**](UI/Miscellaneous.md#reset-password), toggle(enable/disable) and delete account

## Create Account

On top of the page, you can see [**Create Account**](#create-account) button, by clicking on it, you would get a drawer open:
